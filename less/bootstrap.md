### Setting up Bootstrap

#### Get the code
There are many ways to get the bootstrap code. Most people just downloaded it to their project, but I prefer using a git submodule
```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:twbs/bootstrap.git Project/static/bootstrap
```
That way you can stay up to date and pull in the latest fixes easily if you so choose.
